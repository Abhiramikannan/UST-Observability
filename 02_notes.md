SRE FUNDAMENTALS:

1. What is SRE?
SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) is a role and practice in tech companies where software engineers work on making systems more reliable, faster, and able to handle problems automatically.
The idea of SRE came up by Google.

SRE=middle role b/w development and operations

2. What is Devops?
  DevOps is not a tool or a single job — it’s a culture and set of practices that helps different teams in a company work together smoothly.
   It encourages collaboration between teams that usually work separately: Developers,Operations,Architecture,Networking.
   ...work separately (like they are in different "silos" or isolated rooms). That causes confusion, delays, and bugs.
   
3. 5 Key Areas of DevOps
         1. Reduce Organizational Silos: Instead of working separately, all teams work together with shared goals.
         2. Accept Failure as Normal: Focus on recovering quickly and learning from failures.
         3. Implement Gradual Changes: Make small changes. Small changes are easier to test, fix, and release.
         4. Leverage Tooling and Automation: Use tools to automate repetitive tasks like: Deployment, Monitoring, Infra
         5. Measure Everything: Track everything using metrics:->App performance, Deployment time, Error rates, System health.
