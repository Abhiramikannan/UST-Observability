connections -> data source -> infinity

1. INFINITY DATASOURCE:
    Infinity datasource lets Grafana pull data from different sources like CSV, JSON, XML, or Google Sheets that are available online.
    Access parameters →
      Sometimes, the data source you want to connect to is protected (for example, requires an API key or Bearer token). In that case, you’d configure authentication details here.
      If it’s public data, no extra setup is needed. If it’s private, you’d add authentication (like bearer tokens).

2. create dashboard -> add visualization -> create with the instructions from the above link
        select datasource that u created (infinity) -> csv -> get -> url -> table

3. What is VISUALIZATION TYPE (right side while adding the visualization) while configuring the dashboard?
            It indicates how u want to see ur data
            
            1. Table visualization: 
                    data shown in table and rows
            2. Geomap visualization:
                      Data is plotted on a map (world map, region map, or custom map).

            Table = good for detailed raw/structured data
            Geo Data = good for visualizing metrics by location

4. TRANSFORMATIONS:
           In Grafana, when you pull data from a data source (like CSV, Prometheus, InfluxDB, etc.), 
           the data might not always be in the exact format you want for visualization. That’s where Transformations come in.
           Transformations let you modify, filter, join, or restructure your query results before displaying them in a panel.
                    ur panel -> querry type -> transformations
