1. SPLUNK:
      like a search engine for all the machine generated data from ur computer,apps,devices..
      collects all the messy,unstructured data like login failed,user login and organizes it into a searchable format.
      it will make a label for similar data -> easier for search
      This process makes it easy to find and analyze specific events across all your systems, even if they're from different types of devices or applications.
      
2. What is a Splunk Instance?   
          A Splunk instance is a single installation of the Splunk software. 
          Think of it as a single copy of the program running on a computer.
          In a small setup, one instance can handle everything: taking in the data, organizing it, and letting you search it.
          In larger companies, they often use many Splunk instances that work together.
          Some are dedicated to collecting and organizing data (these are called indexers), and others are for running searches and showing dashboards (these are called search heads).
          This setup allows Splunk to handle massive amounts of data and searches at the same time without slowing down.
          
3. What does "Ingesting the Data" mean?
            Ingesting the data simply means getting the data into Splunk. It's the first step in the entire process
            Imagine Splunk as a giant storage locker for all your digital notes and logs. 
            Ingesting is the process of physically moving those notes from where they were created (like a web server or an app) and putting them inside that storage locker.
            Splunk can ingest data in different ways:
                        forwarders: like a delivery trucks put on all ur computers where they collect logs files as they are created and sent them to main splunk instance
                        API and NETWORK PORTS: 
                              NETWORK PORT : Its like a numbered door (eg: port 80)
                                             each computer have many network ports where the applications are listening to
                                             Imagine ur splunk instance is like a house
                                             To get the data inside the house(splunk instance), you need to open the door
                                             Each network port is like a different numbered door on the house
                              Splunk Listens at the Door:
                                             You can tell Splunk to stand at a specific door and wait for data to arrive. This is called "listening" on a port
                              HEC (HTTP Event Collector) is a Special Mailbox:
                                              Special Mailbox (HEC): HEC is like a special, secure mailbox you put outside your house (Splunk).
                                              Applications can directly drop their data into this mailbox using a specific key (a "token").
                                              This is a very clean and direct way to get data in, especially from modern web applications.
                                              the data from different application talk to eachother using API so using spluck you can create a input acalled hec and it can sent the data to the port where splunk is listening
                              Network Ports (TCP/UDP):
                                            some data can be tranferred through port not api
                                            sent log data over internet through certain ports
                                            the data  comes through the port of tcp and udp can be fetched..
                                            by setting up the port the splunk can listen on that port and grab the information
                              
                                                             

4. Can Splunk get data from all environments?
      yes. 
      from cloud(aws,google),computers
      It uses lightweight agents called forwarders to collect data from remote machines and forward it to a central Splunk instance.

5. SPLUNK USES A DATABASE-SPL?
           Splunk works with unstructured data (like logs), not the neat, organized tables of a traditional database. 
           You don't use a standard database query language like SQL. 
           Instead, you use Splunk's own flexible language, SPL (Search Processing Language), to find patterns and relationships within the data.
           This makes it a powerful search tool, not a traditional database.
           
6. Dashboard and panels in splunk?
              can save each specified search as 1 panel
              eg: ou run one specific search (for example, to count the number of failed logins), and that single count will be displayed in one panel on your dashboard.
              Each panel is dedicated to showing the result of its own specific search.

7. Transforming commands?
                  Transforming commands in Splunk change your raw data into a summarized view, like turning a long list of events into a simple chart or table.

8. BOOLEAN OPERATIONS IN SPLUNK?
            AND
            OR
            NOT
            ()
            ""
            \""
      AND is used to find events that contain all of the specified terms. This narrows your search. For example, login AND failed will only show events that have both the word "login" and the word "failed."
      OR is used to find events that contain at least one of the specified terms. This broadens your search. For example, error OR warning will show you any event that contains either "error" or "warning" (or both).
      NOT is used to exclude a specific term from your search results. For example, failed NOT password will show all events with the word "failed" but will remove any that also have the word "password." You can also use a minus sign         (-) as a shorthand for NOT, such as -password
      You can also use parentheses () to group terms and control how the Boolean logic is applied. For example, (login AND failed) OR error will find events that are either "login failed" or just the word "error."

9. Splunk search querry?
            index=network sourcetype=cisco_wsa_squid usage=Violation 
            | stats count(usage) as Visits by cs_username 
            | search Visits > 1

      | -> passes the outcome to the next
      stats count(usage) as Visits: This is a transforming command. It tells Splunk to count the number of times usage appears. It renames the count to a new field called Visits.
      search Visits > 1: This tells Splunk to show only the results where the new field Visits is greater than 1.

10. KNOWLEDGE OBJECTS?
             knowledge objects are things you create and save so Splunk can use them to better understand your data. They are the rules and definitions you build to make your data smarter.
             eg: When you create a search command and save it to use again later, that is a type of knowledge object called a Saved Search or Report.
                  It's a way to save your work so you don't have to rebuild the search every time, making it much easier and faster for you and others to get the same results.
            lookup is a knowledge object -> Adds extra information to your data based on a separate file you provided.
            Report is a knowledge object-> Re-runs the same search every time.

11. 3 ROLES ?
            ADMIN
            POWER
            USER

12. KNOWLEDGE OBJECTS ARE GROUPED INTO 5 CATEGORIES?
            Data Classification, -> classifying data into diff categories(tags to group similar events)
            Data Normalization,-> This is the process of cleaning and standardizing your data. eg: making sure all the dates are in the same format 
            Data Enrichment, and -> This step adds new, valuable information to your existing data. For instance, if your data has an IP address, you can "enrich" it by adding the city and country that IP address is from.
                                    This is often done using a lookup table
            Data Interpretation -> This is the final step where you look at the cleaned, enriched data to find meaningful insights, like trends or patterns. This is where you might create charts or reports to visualize your findings.
                                    Data Interpretation is done by creating Reports and Dashboards which use your classified, normalized, and enriched data to find insights.

13. can we add the report as panels in the dashboard in splunk?
            yes
            When you save a search as a report, it becomes a knowledge object that you can reuse. 
            One of the most common ways to reuse a report is to add it as a panel on a dashboard. 
            This allows you to display the results of that report alongside other information, providing a comprehensive, high-level view of your data in a single place.

14. can also edit the drill down in each panel..why it is used?
            detailed view of information

15. what is dashboard studio?
            Dashboard Studio is a modern dashboard-building environment in Splunk.
            easy to customize ur dashboard.
