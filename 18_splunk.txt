1. SPLUNK:
      like a search engine for all the machine generated data from ur computer,apps,devices..
      collects all the messy,unstructured data like login failed,user login and organizes it into a searchable format.
      it will make a label for similar data -> easier for search
      This process makes it easy to find and analyze specific events across all your systems, even if they're from different types of devices or applications.
      
2. What is a Splunk Instance?   
          A Splunk instance is a single installation of the Splunk software. 
          Think of it as a single copy of the program running on a computer.
          In a small setup, one instance can handle everything: taking in the data, organizing it, and letting you search it.
          In larger companies, they often use many Splunk instances that work together.
          Some are dedicated to collecting and organizing data (these are called indexers), and others are for running searches and showing dashboards (these are called search heads).
          This setup allows Splunk to handle massive amounts of data and searches at the same time without slowing down.
          
3. What does "Ingesting the Data" mean?
            Ingesting the data simply means getting the data into Splunk. It's the first step in the entire process
            Imagine Splunk as a giant storage locker for all your digital notes and logs. 
            Ingesting is the process of physically moving those notes from where they were created (like a web server or an app) and putting them inside that storage locker.
            Splunk can ingest data in different ways:
                        forwarders: like a delivery trucks put on all ur computers where they collect logs files as they are created and sent them to main splunk instance
                        API and NETWORK PORTS: 
                              NETWORK PORT : Its like a numbered door (eg: port 80)
                                             each computer have many network ports where the applications are listening to
                                             Imagine ur splunk instance is like a house
                                             To get the data inside the house(splunk instance), you need to open the door
                                             Each network port is like a different numbered door on the house
                              Splunk Listens at the Door:
                                             You can tell Splunk to stand at a specific door and wait for data to arrive. This is called "listening" on a port
                              HEC (HTTP Event Collector) is a Special Mailbox:
                                              Special Mailbox (HEC): HEC is like a special, secure mailbox you put outside your house (Splunk).
                                              Applications can directly drop their data into this mailbox using a specific key (a "token").
                                              This is a very clean and direct way to get data in, especially from modern web applications.
                                              the data from different application talk to eachother using API so using spluck you can create a input acalled hec and it can sent the data to the port where splunk is listening
                              Network Ports (TCP/UDP):
                                            some data can be tranferred through port not api
                                            sent log data over internet through certain ports
                                            the data  comes through the port of tcp and udp can be fetched..
                                            by setting up the port the splunk can listen on that port and grab the information
                              
                                                             

4. Can Splunk get data from all environments?
      yes. 
      from cloud(aws,google),computers
      It uses lightweight agents called forwarders to collect data from remote machines and forward it to a central Splunk instance.

5. SPLUNK USES A DATABASE-SPL?
           Splunk works with unstructured data (like logs), not the neat, organized tables of a traditional database. 
           You don't use a standard database query language like SQL. 
           Instead, you use Splunk's own flexible language, SPL (Search Processing Language), to find patterns and relationships within the data.
           This makes it a powerful search tool, not a traditional database.
           
6. Dashboard and panels in splunk?
              can save each specified search as 1 panel
              eg: ou run one specific search (for example, to count the number of failed logins), and that single count will be displayed in one panel on your dashboard.
              Each panel is dedicated to showing the result of its own specific search.
