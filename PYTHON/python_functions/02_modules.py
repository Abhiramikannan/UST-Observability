#module contains many buildin functions,variables .. that can be used in program any time by importing it.
import math
num=25
b=math.sqrt(num)

#directly can import using below line and dont want to use math.sqrt(num)
from math import sqrt # here imported so dont want to write math.sqrt(num)
num=25
b=sqrt(num) # no need of math here now
