Collections are built-in data structures in Python used to store and organize data.

List : Ordered, changeable, allow duplicate members
Tuple: ordered, unchangeable , allow duplicate ,members
Dictionary: Ordered,changeable,No duplicate members
Set: unordered,unchangeable, not indexed, not allow duplicate members

USED FOR:
List for ordered sequences.
Set for uniqueness.
Dict for key-value mapping.

COLLECTION TYPES:
List

Ordered, mutable, allows duplicates.
Example: numbers = [1, 2, 3]



Tuple

Ordered, immutable, allows duplicates.
Example: coords = (10, 20)



Set

Unordered, mutable, no duplicates.
Example: unique_items = {1, 2, 3}



Dictionary

Key-value pairs, insertion order preserved (Python 3.7+).
Example: person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}


ADVANCED COLLECTIONS:
deque: Double-ended queue for fast append/pop from both ends.
OrderedDict: Maintains insertion order (though normal dict does this now).
ChainMap: Combines multiple dictionaries.


Q. Difference between list and tuple?

List: Mutable, can be changed after creation.
Tuple: Immutable, cannot be changed after creation.
Lists use more memory; tuples are faster and hashable (can be dictionary keys).

Q. Why are sets faster for membership checks than lists?

Sets use hash tables internally, so lookup is O(1) on average.
Lists require linear search, so lookup is O(n).

Q. How does Python implement dictionaries internally?

Dictionaries use hash tables.
Keys must be hashable (immutable types like str, int, tuple).
Collisions are handled using open addressing.

Q. What is hashability?

An object is hashable if it has a hash value that does not change during its lifetime and can be compared to other objects.
Immutable types (str, int, tuple) are hashable; mutable types (list, dict) are not.

Q. What is the difference between OrderedDict and normal dict?

Before Python 3.7, normal dicts were unordered.
From Python 3.7+, normal dict preserves insertion order.
OrderedDict was used earlier for maintaining order explicitly.

Q. What is a defaultdict?

A dictionary that provides a default value for missing keys.

Q. When would you use deque instead of list?

When you need fast append and pop from both ends.
deque operations on both ends are O(1), while list operations at the start are O(n).
