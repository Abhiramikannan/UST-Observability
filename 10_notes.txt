1. NOTIFICATION POLICY?

  Notification Policy – Think of it like a mailman’s delivery rule.
    It decides where and to whom the alert should go, and when.
    You can set rules:
          “If the alert is about database, send it to the DB team.”
          “If the alert is about frontend, send it to the web team.”
          “If it’s at night, send it to the on-call person.”
          Controls the route & timing of the message.

2. LOKI?

      Grafana's owm log system
      Loki = stores logs (text details about what happened, like errors, warnings, events).
      it only stores indexes labels (like app name, pod name, namespace).
      In Grafana → Connections → Data Sources → Add Loki (URL: http://loki:3100).
      Grafana -> explore -> datasource- loki -> querry language of loki type
      Example: {filename="/var/log/tns-app.log"}
              consider an app where u can provide title and url.. provide only title without url..in logs..u can see error

3. ANNOTATIONS?

        Annotations in Grafana are markers or notes you place directly on your graphs to show when something important happened.
        Eg: “Oh, that spike happened right when we deployed a new version”.

        2 types of annotations:
              Manual annotations: You click on the graph and write something (e.g., "Migrated user database").
                                  Or select a time range (region annotation) and describe what happened (e.g., "Load testing").

              Automatic annotations: Grafana can pull events from data sources (like Loki logs) and add them automatically.
                                     Example: Every time the log contains the word "error", an annotation appears on the graph.
