1. NOTIFICATION POLICY?

  Notification Policy – Think of it like a mailman’s delivery rule.
    It decides where and to whom the alert should go, and when.
    You can set rules:
          “If the alert is about database, send it to the DB team.”
          “If the alert is about frontend, send it to the web team.”
          “If it’s at night, send it to the on-call person.”
          Controls the route & timing of the message.
