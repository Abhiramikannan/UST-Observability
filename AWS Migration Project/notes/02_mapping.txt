Mapping of app account (where the instance belongs to) and application:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The architecture is event-driven.
2. If some event occurs, Aws sents the information to eventbridge.
3. EventBridge triggers lambda to capture host details and instance details.
4. DescribeHosts - will give u instance Id and host Id
5. currently u have instanceId so lambda can assume role in app accounts using cross account access role and fetch information.
6. lambda uses DescribeInstances API to fetch instance details which includes:
		accountId(which aws account that instance owns) = app account
		Tags ( Which application is running)=application name
lambda triggers when Instance launch,Terminate, Host failure, Tag update.
7. So you have the host,app account, application.
8. Lambda maps it.
9. Write a code inside lambda to fetch the required fields from DescribeInstances and create a mapping table.
10. Also lambda stores this mapping table to a database.
11. Most best choice DB is DYNAMO DB
12. Dynamo db is serverless and not complex.
