Mapping of app account (where the instance belongs to) and application:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The architecture is event-driven.
2. If some event occurs, Aws sents the information to eventbridge(First place where aws send service events=Default Event Bridge)
3. EventBridge triggers lambda to capture host details and instance details.
4. DescribeHosts - will give u instance Id and host Id
5. currently u have instanceId so lambda can assume role in app accounts using cross account access role and fetch information.
6. lambda uses DescribeInstances API to fetch instance details which includes:
		accountId(which aws account that instance owns) = app account
		Tags ( Which application is running)=application name
lambda triggers when Instance launch,Terminate, Host failure, Tag update.
7. So you have the host,app account, application.
8. Lambda maps it.
9. Write a code inside lambda to fetch the required fields from DescribeInstances and create a mapping table.
10. Also lambda stores this mapping table to a database.
11. Most best choice DB is DYNAMO DB
12. Dynamo db is serverless and not complex.


If host went Down, Can we fetch the details:
------------------------------------------
Yes, Aws have metadata in the control plane.(wont get full details if the instance terminated).
Lambda can get details if the host goes down — but only if you capture them at event time.
That’s why the best practice is: extract and persist the mapping immediately when the event triggers (into DynamoDB).
You’ll get the details if you query at the time of the event. If you wait until after termination, you risk losing them.



No database-DynamoDB approach
-----------------------------------
1. They aggreed to have the solution without DynamoDb
2. They only want real time data values.
3. No historical events will be there
