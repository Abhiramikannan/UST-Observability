cold start of lambda and how to reduce the cold start of lambda


AWS Lambda runs only when an event occurs.
If Lambda is not triggered for a long time:
AWS may remove its execution environment
When the next event occurs, Lambda takes slightly longer to start
This delay is called Cold Start

⭐ How We Prevent Cold Start
We keep Lambda active by triggering it periodically using AWS EventBridge.(warmstart)

⭐ How It Works
We create an EventBridge scheduled rule
This rule triggers the Lambda function every 5 minutes
When Lambda receives this scheduled trigger, it performs a small check and exits immediately
This keeps the Lambda environment active and reduces cold start delays
When a real infrastructure event occurs, Lambda runs normally and performs mapping logic

Permissions Required:
EventBridge → Lambda
EventBridge requires permission to invoke Lambda.
lambda:InvokeFunction
EventBridge → Lambda invoke permission  aws automatically add



lambda only does this:
Starts Lambda execution environment
This includes:
	Starting container
	Loading runtime (Python, Node, etc.)
	Loading your code
	Initializing libraries
	Preparing memory
	
rule written inside eventbridge:
1. Schedule Rule
rule name: lambda-warmup-rule
event pattern type: Schedule
Schedule Expression: rate(5 minutes)
Target: Your Lambda Function


This is a message sent to Lambda when EventBridge scheduled rule triggers it:
{
  "source": "aws.events"
}

called event payload
making lambda know by this json:
	Warm-up trigger OR Real AWS event?



lambda checks the event is scheduled one(warm event ) or real infra event. Then triggers.
if warm event= exit immediately after preparing memory and all.
