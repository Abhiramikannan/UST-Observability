Q. host?
        aws name for physical server
        physical server (real computer)

Q. hardware?
        Hardware = the physical parts of a host / physical server

Q. what is dedicated hosts?
        A Dedicated Host is a physical EC2 server(host) fully reserved for a single AWS customer, allowing control over instance placement, licensing, and compliance.
        You are not sharing the hardware with anyone else.
Normal EC2 vs Dedicated Host (Easy Comparison)
    Normal EC2 (Shared Infrastructure)
        virtual machine
        Your EC2 runs on shared physical servers
        Other AWS customers may be on the same hardware
        You don’t know or control where your EC2 is placed
        AWS manages everything automatically
        🧠 Think of it like:
            Renting a flat in an apartment building

Dedicated Host
    physical machine
    A real physical server
    You get an entire physical server
    Only your EC2 instances run on it
    You can see the host
    You control how many EC2s run on it
    Useful for compliance & licensing
    🧠 Think of it like:
    Renting the entire building

Q. where is dedicated host exists?
        A Dedicated Host exists physically inside an AWS data center.
        Located in an AWS data center
        Inside a specific Availability Zone (AZ)
        Fully reserved for one AWS customer

Q. what we manages and aws manages on dedicated hosts?
        aws - manages the hardware,networking,host os...
        customer manage: how many aws instances run on the host
                         instance type
                         when to stop/start the instances
                         monitoring,dashboards, alerts

Q. what is cloudwatch?
    CloudWatch is an AWS monitoring service that includes dashboards
    CloudWatch watches your AWS resources and tells you what’s happening.
    CloudWatch helps you see, measure, and alert on your AWS resources.
    It mainly does 4 things:
            Collects Metrics(EC2 CPU usage)
            Stores Logs(Application logs)
            Creates Alarms(Automatic alerts)
            Dashboards = visual view

Q. Diff b/w grafana and cloudwatch in here?
        CloudWatch automatically collects and stores monitoring data from AWS resources, 
        while Grafana does not collect data itself and instead visualizes data from external sources
         like CloudWatch, Newrelic, Elasticsearch

Q. How to monitor dedicated instances?  
        wont watch dedicated instances directly. u monitor:
            1. Dedicated Hosts (physical machine level)
            2. EC2 instances running on those hosts (VM level)

Q. is dedicated instance and dedicated host are diff?
        yes.
        So dedicated instances:
            its a private ec2 instance.
            The hardware is owned by ur account.. That means it is managed by aws.
            U cannot see the host(hardware=bodyparts) (How many other VMs share the machine,motherboard)
            U cannot see where the machine that u are using runs.
            no other vm will be there on that physical server but u cant see.
    dedicated hosts:
            a physical server(computer)
            completely reserved for u
            hardware part managed by aws
            decison of how many instances should run and all by u
            no sharing of hardware

    normal ec2 instance:
        shared host or hardware
        managed by aws
        cant see the host.

Q. what is hardware, host, physical server?
        hardware= real components of computer.
        physical server= one real machine(computer)
        Host = physical server used to run virtual machines
            
                            
               
Q. how to monitor the dedicated instnaces, what the metrics, logs and traces need to be monitored etc.
        Monitoring is osne by amazon cloud watch
        3 levels:
            1. Host level      → Physical server (Dedicated Host)
            2. Instance level  → EC2 (VM)
            3. Application     → App inside EC2
        Basic metrics are automatically collected by CloudWatch, 
        logs are collected using the CloudWatch Agent,
         and traces are collected using AWS X-Ray.

Q.why they want custom metrics and not normal cloudwatch metrics?
        cloudwatch will know cpu,status checks
        cloudwatch dont know “How many EC2s per host by application”(many applications are there)
                              “Is this distribution risky?”
        so they want to build custom logic

Q. what is cloud formation?
        Aws way to create resources instaed of clicking console
        code
        This is called IAC(Infrastructure as code)
        easy to deploy, do automatically.
        eg: creation of IAM, DASHBOARDS.

Q. What is CloudFormation StackSets?
        Normal Cloud Formation = deploy to 1 aws account
        Stackset= deploys the same template to many accounts in many region, automatically

Q. what are app accounts?
        aws can be splitted into ccoe/platform account = Owns infrastructure like Dedicated Hosts,
                                 app accounts = Run applications (EC2, apps, workloads), 
                                 security/logging accounts = Security & audit.
        Dedicated Hosts → owned by CCOE account
        EC2 instances → launched by app accounts
        Tags (Application, Env, Cluster) → live in app accounts
    👉 That’s why monitoring needs cross-account access.


Q. what is cross account acces?
        Cross-account access means: one AWS account is allowed to access resources in another AWS account.
        
Q. Why we need lambda? What is lambda?
        Lambda is a small piece of code that runs automatically when triggered.
        Lambda runs in CCOE account
        Runs only when needed
        Perfect for automation
        has no server.

Q. Why cant promethous? will not run as orchestration level.
Q. How to find logs, traces, custom metrics using lambda?
--------------------------------
ABOUT MY PROJECT: from 13/1/26
--------------------------------
1. ec2 instances = 10000
2. Architecture:
        EventBridge triggers Lambda → Lambda collects & calculates → CloudWatch stores → Dashboards & alerts show health and risk.
3. where will we implement the solution?
    1. we need a dedicated host to monitor
    2. They didnt started migration of ec2 to dedicated hosts.
    3. Then how we implement the solution? where?
    4. They have dedicated host existing in their sandbox or non prod environments.
    5. We will test our logic there.

4. while creating a mock up dashboard. He said to set threshold. he mentioned as amber. whats that?
            yellow colour

5. what is blast score?
        if host goes down, How many applications got impacted


6. Whats my understanding?
        1. each app will have different end point in cloud watch and grafana
        2. We need to codify the full architecture using terraform
        3. Only dashboard creation will be manual.
        4. Individual app will have individual cloud watch account
        5. Individual app will have individual lambda and individual event bridges
        6. Using common lambda and implementing the logic
        7. Each app will have its own dashboard

    

8. Cloud watch agent installation:
        1.using terraform or
        2.Enable agent installation automatically during EC2 instance creation



9. What GuardDuty and IAM Access Analyzer are
GuardDuty: 
    Security Guard for ur aws acc 
    It watches activity logs in AWS and alerts you if something suspicious happens.
    It looks at:
        CloudTrail logs → who is calling AWS APIs
        Vpc flow logs(Network traffic), DNS logs

examples :
        Someone trying to access your AWS account from another country
        An EC2 instance talking to a known malicious IP
        IAM credentials being misused
        A compromised instance running crypto-mining
guardDuty just alerts , wont block u.
        alerts can be seen in: GuardDuty console, AWS Security Hub

10. What is IAM Access Analyzer
       permssion checker 
       it answers: “Who can access my AWS resources?”
       It analyzes IAM policies and tells you if something is too open.
       helps u to follow least privilage
       Iam access analyser wont give u alerts, it shows findings ->AWS Console → IAM → Access Analyzer
       eg:
       S3 bucket accessible from another AWS account
       Lambda role has more permissions than needed
       Policies violating least-privilege

11. Flow of diagram from security:
    GuardDuty:
    1. aws records automatically: Who is calling AWS APIs (CloudTrail),Network traffic (VPC Flow Logs)
    2. GuardDuty reads these logs automatically-looks for its bad behaviour
    3. If find something suspicious(findings)
    4. sent that finding to event bridge
    5. EventBridge triggers your Lambda(eventbridge sent the findings to same lambda)
    6.lambda sents data to cloudwatch- cloudwatch write security logs and metrices
    7. grafna reads the cloudwatch

    IAM access analyser:
    1. checks IAM policies(lambda role,Eventbridge role,S3 bucket policy,KMS policy)
    2. if any of these are too Open-risk -thats the finding
    3. sents finding to eventbridge
    4. eventbridge triggers-sent that findings to same lambda
    5.lambda sents data to cloudwatch- cloudwatch write security logs and metrices
    6. grafna reads the cloudwatch


12. what is finding Id? who generates it?
    
    Finding id:
    1. If some issue happens- aws automatically creates finding id
    2. aws security detect services(GuardDuty, IAM access analyzer,AWS Config,Security Hub) detects the issue and
    3. creates the finding id automatically,
    4. you can see that ID in their consoles (GuardDuty / Security Hub) and APIs.
    5. eg: Someone tries to log in and fails many times,Security group is opened to the internet,Root account is used
    6. These examples - AWS CloudTrail records this event
    7. U can see the finding id: AWS Console → GuardDuty → Findings
    8. also -AWS Console → Security Hub → Findings


13. what is Finding TYpe? who will generate it? where u can see that?
        Finding type:
        1. Finding Type describes WHAT the security issue is.
        2. eg: Root account was used, Multiple failed logins, Security group is public, IAM policy was changed
        3. AWS security services generate it automatically
        4. u wont create finding type manually
        5. It is created based on predefined rules inside AWS services.
        6. where u can find it: AWS Console → GuardDuty → Findings

how this works:
    1. CloudTrail logs everything
    2. Security services read CloudTrail
    3. They analyze events
    4. If something looks dangerous → finding created

14. What is status in that panel?
        1. Its the status of finding
        2. If issue detected-> findings created
        3. u can see:    Workflow status = NEW in AWS Security Hub → Findings
        4. fix the problem.
        5. after fixing manually go to security console and mark as resolved.
        6. This is a manual task.

15. what is cloudtrail?
    1. aws activity recorder
    2. It records everything that happens in your AWS account.
    3. eg: who loggedin, who created ec2 instances, who deleted s3 bucket.
