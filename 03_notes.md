UNDERSTANDING PILLARS OF OBSERVABILITY:

<img width="1882" height="882" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02692073-cc77-489f-ac0f-dce226d4ba49" />


Observability:  
      knowing internal states of a system from external outputs.
      collecting the information about whats happening inside the system.

collecting 3 informations i.e, 3 pillars of observability:

                1. metrices
                2. logs
                3. traces
                
some components working for that:
        1. collectors: 1 or more collectors to fetch the data
        2. 1 or more data stores
        3. various tools that make use of this data -> power ur dashboards, alerts,automation...



1. metrices: snapshot of set of numbers. Numeric data collected over time to measure the health or performance of systems.Used for monitoring performance, detecting anomalies, setting alerts.

3. logs: Logs are text-based records automatically generated by applications and systems. They help developers and SREs understand what happened, when it happened, and where it happened.

   The image shows two types of logs:

                  Web Server (Apache) Log
                  
                  Application Log (CSV format)

       1. Apache Web Server Log

                sample log entry:
   
                             83.149.9.216 - - [08/May/2025:10:05:24 +0000] 
                            "GET /presentations/logstash-monitorama/images/1983_delorean_dmc-12-pic-38289.jpeg HTTP/1.1" 200 220562 
                            "http://semicomplete.com/presentations/logstash-monitorama/" 
                            "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_1)..."

                        | Part                           | Meaning                                             |
                        | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
                        | `83.149.9.216`                 | IP address of the user who accessed the server      |
                        | `[08/May/2025:10:05:24 +0000]` | **Timestamp** when the request was made             |
                        | `GET`                          | HTTP method used (in this case, it’s a GET request) |
                        | `/presentations/...jpeg`       | The file/resource the user requested                |
                        | `HTTP/1.1`                     | Protocol version                                    |
                        | `200`                          | HTTP status code (**200 = success**)                |
                        | `220562`                       | Size of the response (in bytes)                     |
                        | `"http://semicomplete.com/...` | Referrer (page that led to this request)            |
                        | `"Mozilla/5.0...`              | User-Agent (browser and OS of the requester)        |


      2. Application Log (from a CSV)

                sample log entry: 2025-05-08T12:28:15Z,35A2B2DB5232,ERROR,Fulfilment errored! Request ID: 30068808. Error message: document service unavailable.

              | Part                     | Meaning                                                |
              | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
              | `2025-05-08T12:28:15Z`   | **Timestamp** (ISO format — date + time in UTC)        |
              | `35A2B2DB5232`           | Unique ID (could be session ID, transaction ID, etc.)  |
              | `ERROR`                  | **Log level** — could be INFO, WARNING, ERROR, etc.    |
              | `Fulfilment errored!...` | **Message** — describes the actual issue that occurred |

         This log is showing an error during some order fulfilment, with a specific Request ID. The error message says that the "document service is unavailable", which likely means a backend service was down.

         Tools That Use These Logs:
         
                 Logstash / Elasticsearch / Kibana

                 Azure Monitor / AWS CloudWatch
                
                 Datadog, Splunk, Grafana Loki

         Logs help:

                Debug errors
                
                Audit what users did
                
                Track performance issues
                
                Trigger alerts when something goes wrong

                helps in alerting

4. traces:

 <img width="1919" height="1069" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68f65c24-1f3d-494c-8923-d4c18107cd2a" />

        Get product service -> taking 0.38 seconds.
        GET /authz | 0.09s -> authorization service was called, taking 0.09 seconds.
        GET /p | 0.25s: Another call, possibly to a product service, taking 0.25 seconds.
        DB | 0.19s: A database query, taking 0.19 seconds.

   the distributed trace tells you the breakdown of all of those pieces of" (the rest is cut off). If a user complains that "the website is slow," distributed tracing helps you pinpoint exactly where the delay happened. Was it in the authorization service? The product service? The database?
   This allows engineers to quickly identify and fix performance bottlenecks or errors in complex, modern applications. It gives you a detailed "story" of each request's journey through your system.



  1. Published after the event: after the request.. traces publishes
  2. Service graph: Imagine a map of all your services and how they talk to each other. A trace shows you the actual paths requests take through this map, helping you visualize the dependencies and interactions between different parts of your system.
  3. Root cause analysis and alerting
