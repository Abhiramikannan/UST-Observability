Goal: Build a "Golden Signals Overview" Dashboard
-----------------------------------------------------------

You will create a new Grafana dashboard focusing on the four Golden Signals for a hypothetical web service or API. This will include:

Latency: How long requests take.

Traffic (or Throughput): How much demand is being placed on your system.

Errors: The rate of requests that fail.

Saturation: How "full" your service is.

You'll use Grafana's Stat panels for a quick visual summary and Graph panels to see trends over time, applying thresholds for quick status checks.

Step-by-Step Guide: Building the "Golden Signals" Dashboard
Step 1: Access Grafana Cloud & Create a New Dashboard
Log in to Grafana Cloud: Go to your Grafana Cloud instance.

Create New Dashboard:

On the left-hand menu, click the + icon.

Select New dashboard.

You'll see an empty canvas with an "Add visualization" button.

Step 2: Add Panels for Latency
We'll use both a Stat panel (for current status) and a Graph panel (for trends).

Panel 1: Latency (Current Stat)
Add Visualization: Click Add visualization.

Choose Data Source: Select Test Data Source.

Configure Query Tab:

Scenario: Random Walk

Min: 50 (milliseconds, for a healthy base)

Max: 1000 (milliseconds, allowing for spikes)

Interval: 1s (data changes every second)

Alias: Service Latency

Legend: Service Latency (ensure this is clear).

Configure Visualization Tab:

Type: Select Stat.

Panel Title: Service Latency (Current)

Unit: ms (milliseconds)

Color mode: Background

Graph mode: Area (shows a mini-graph behind the number)

Justify space: Center

Thresholds (Lower is Better):

Value 200, Color Green

Value 500, Color Orange

(Values below 200ms will be Green, 200ms-499ms will be Orange, 500ms+ will be Red)

Apply.

Panel 2: Latency (Trend Graph)
Add Visualization: Click Add visualization (or duplicate the previous panel and change type).

Choose Data Source: Select Test Data Source.

Configure Query Tab:

Scenario: Random Walk (same as above)

Min: 50

Max: 1000

Interval: 1s

Alias: Service Latency Trend

Configure Visualization Tab:

Type: Select Graph.

Panel Title: Service Latency (Trend)

Axes -> Left Y -> Unit: ms (milliseconds)

Thresholds (Add Lines to Graph):

Click Add threshold.

Value: 200, Color: Green, Fill: No, Y-axis: Left, Line: Solid (Label: "Warning")

Click Add threshold.

Value: 500, Color: Red, Fill: No, Y-axis: Left, Line: Solid (Label: "Critical")

Apply.

Step 3: Add Panels for Traffic (Requests Per Second)
Panel 3: Traffic (Current Stat)
Add Visualization: Click Add visualization.

Choose Data Source: Select Test Data Source.

Configure Query Tab:

Scenario: Random Walk

Min: 100 (requests/second, for a baseline)

Max: 500 (requests/second, simulating higher load)

Interval: 1s

Alias: Service Traffic

Configure Visualization Tab:

Type: Select Stat.

Panel Title: Service Traffic (Current)

Unit: RPS (Requests Per Second - you might need to type this custom unit)

Color mode: None (Traffic usually isn't red/green, just a measure of volume, unless you have specific capacity limits)

Graph mode: Area

Justify space: Center

Thresholds: Not typically used for traffic unless there's a specific "too much traffic" or "too little traffic" alert. You can add one if you want to highlight very high or very low traffic.

Apply.

Panel 4: Traffic (Trend Graph)
Add Visualization: Click Add visualization.

Choose Data Source: Select Test Data Source.

Configure Query Tab:

Scenario: Random Walk (same as above)

Min: 100

Max: 500

Interval: 1s

Alias: Service Traffic Trend

Configure Visualization Tab:

Type: Select Graph.

Panel Title: Service Traffic (Trend)

Axes -> Left Y -> Unit: RPS

Thresholds: (Optional) Add lines if you want to indicate normal operating range or capacity limits on the graph.

Apply.

Step 4: Add Panels for Errors (Error Rate)
Panel 5: Error Rate (Current Stat)
Add Visualization: Click Add visualization.

Choose Data Source: Select Test Data Source.

Configure Query Tab:

Scenario: Random Walk

Min: 0

Max: 10 (simulating 0-10% error rate)

Interval: 1s

Alias: Service Error Rate

Configure Visualization Tab:

Type: Select Stat.

Panel Title: Service Error Rate (Current)

Unit: %

Color mode: Background

Graph mode: Area

Justify space: Center

Thresholds (Lower is Better):

Value 1, Color Green (e.g., 1% or less is good)

Value 5, Color Orange (e.g., 1%-5% is warning)

(Values below 1% will be Green, 1%-4.99% will be Orange, 5%+ will be Red)

Apply.

Panel 6: Error Rate (Trend Graph)
Add Visualization: Click Add visualization.

Choose Data Source: Select Test Data Source.

Configure Query Tab:

Scenario: Random Walk (same as above)

Min: 0

Max: 10

Interval: 1s

Alias: Service Error Rate Trend

Configure Visualization Tab:

Type: Select Graph.

Panel Title: Service Error Rate (Trend)

Axes -> Left Y -> Unit: %

Thresholds: (Add lines to graph)

Value 1, Color Green

Value 5, Color **Red`

Apply.

Step 5: Add Panels for Saturation (Resource Utilization)
Panel 7: Saturation (Current Stat)
Add Visualization: Click Add visualization.

Choose Data Source: Select Test Data Source.

Configure Query Tab:

Scenario: Random Walk

Min: 20

Max: 100 (simulating 20-100% utilization)

Interval: 1s

Alias: Service Saturation

Configure Visualization Tab:

Type: Select Stat.

Panel Title: Service Saturation (Current)

Unit: %

Color mode: Background

Graph mode: Area

Justify space: Center

Thresholds (Lower is Better):

Value 70, Color Green (e.g., <70% utilization is good)

Value 90, Color Orange (e.g., 70%-89% utilization is warning)

(Values below 70% will be Green, 70%-89% will be Orange, 90%+ will be Red)

Apply.

Panel 8: Saturation (Trend Graph)
Add Visualization: Click Add visualization.

Choose Data Source: Select Test Data Source.

Configure Query Tab:

Scenario: Random Walk (same as above)

Min: 20

Max: 100

Interval: 1s

Alias: Service Saturation Trend

Configure Visualization Tab:

Type: Select Graph.

Panel Title: Service Saturation (Trend)

Axes -> Left Y -> Unit: %

Thresholds: (Add lines to graph)

Value 70, Color Green

Value 90, Color **Red`

Apply.

Step 6: Arrange and Save Your Dashboard
Arrange Panels:

Drag and resize the panels to create a clear layout. A good idea is to put the "Current Stat" next to its "Trend Graph" for each Golden Signal. You might organize them into four rows, one for each signal.

Set Dashboard Time Range: At the top right of the dashboard, set the time range (e.g., Last 1 hour, Last 3 hours). Since the TestData Random Walk is dynamic, you'll see the graphs update.

Set Dashboard Refresh Rate: Next to the time range, set a refresh interval (e.g., 5s, 15s). This will make your "Current Stat" panels update and your "Trend Graphs" scroll.

Save Dashboard: Click the Save icon (floppy disk) at the top.

Give your dashboard a Name (e.g., "Golden Signals Overview").

Click Save.
