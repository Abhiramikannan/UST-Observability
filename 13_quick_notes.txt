1. ALERTS
          I learned about how to create and manage alerts in Grafana.
          Setting threshold -> so that if the threshold goes beyond that have setted -> notify it as an alert in the contact point(webhook)
          
         Notification template: It will make the alert well structured and can fetch the live data  from the alert labels/ annotations.(eg : instance name,cpu value)

         Annotations: Markers shown in graph to see what happened.

         Notification policy: It will make all alert msg(similar alerts) as a single msg (grouping) and forwards to particular team. eg: database related alert -> database team


2. ERROR BUDGET AND BURN RATE:
            Error budget : allowed failure eg: if SLA is 99% uptime ,error budget is 0.1 %
            Burn rate: How fast u r using ur error budget

3. METRICES:
          RED = Rate, Errors, Duration(used in microservices,API monitoring) 
          How many req are coming , how many fail, how long they take
          
          USE =  Utilization,Saturation,Errrors.(monitoring resources- used in infrastructure/resources like cpu,memory,disk
          	  •  Utilization → How much of a resource is being used (CPU %, memory usage)
              •  Saturation → How “full” it is (queue length, waiting processes)
              •  Errors → Hardware or system errors


4. DASHBOARD: what all i know still now?

          panels creation
          visualization type
          datasource(infinity,testdata,prometheus,loki)
          colour coded threshhold
          unit
          
5. GOOGLES GOLDEN SIGNALS:

          traffic
          latency
          errors
          saturation : How overloaded ur system resources ? heavy load -> system breaks

6. SLA AND SLO UPTIME:

          SLA = b/w company and  customers.
                promise them 99.9% uptime ,if not give refund

          SLO = internal objective for teams
                teams target(99.9% uptime)

          SLI = actual measurement of metric
                metric is uptime,errors,latency
                calculated by anytime
