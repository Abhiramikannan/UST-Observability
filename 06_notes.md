1. IRM:IRM simply means Incident Response Management (sometimes called Incident and Request Management in ITSM). Itâ€™s the process of:

                  Detecting when something goes wrong in a system or service.
                  
                  Responding quickly to fix it.
                  
                  Documenting what happened and how it was resolved.
       
       
   
2. REACTIVE ALERTING VS PROACTIVE ALERTING VS PREDICTIVE ALERTING:

     REACTIVE ALERTING: after the issue already occured. It will let u knw somethg is broken ,go and fix that. eg: A server CPU hits 100% and the system sends an alert.
     Users are already experiencing slowness when you get the notification.

     PROACTIVE ALERTING: It will let u know before the particular issue becomes major problem.
                         Catch early warning signs to prevent failures.Example: Alert triggers when CPU usage is steadily above 80% for 10 minutes. You have time to scale resources before it reaches 100%.

     PREDICTIVE ALERTING: Use historical patterns + AI/ML to predict an upcoming issue.Monitoring predicts memory will run out in 2 hours if usage keeps growing.
                           Sends an alert so you can fix it before it happens. Avoid incidents entirely.
                         eg: Your smart home predicts a high chance of fire tomorrow based on past cooking patterns.
